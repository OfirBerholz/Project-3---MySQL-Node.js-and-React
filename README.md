Vacation Project - Full Stack Web App (MySQL, Node.js and React)

# Dependencies:

MySQL with phpMyAdmin

## Import the Database:

1. Open phpMyAdmin - I used XAMPP to run a MariaDB MySQL Server.
2. Import Vacations.sql to a new database named Vacations.
3. Make sure the following MySQL connection settings are correct inside the file config-dev.json located in the Backend:
   - Database Host: localhost
   - Database Name: Vacations
   - Database User: root
   - Database Default Password: (empty)
